<name>Post Rock Scenic Byway</name>
<description>As you travel the lush rolling hills of nature's roller coaster, the Post Rock Scenic Byway, limestone outcroppings vein the Smoky Hills around beautiful Wilson Lake. Industrious early settlers quarried this creamy-buff, brown-striped native limestone rock for buildings, bridges, and fenceposts. Durable yet easy to carve, this stone, still quarried today, lends itself to the embellishment of the most modest of structures through creations of elaborate folk art environments.</description>
