<name>Arroyo Seco Historic Parkway - Route 110_0</name>
<description>The Arroyo Seco Parkway connects Los Angeles and Pasadena through the historic Arts and Crafts landscape of the Arroyo Seco. Conceived in the parkway tradition with gentle curves, lush landscaping, and scenic vistas, the byway incorporated the modern elements that would lay the groundwork for the California freeway system.</description>
