<name>Scenic & Historic A1A Highway</name>
<description>Along the Scenic and Historic A1A Highway one experiences rural ambiance between the river and the sea--nineteen miles of bikeway, walkway and waterway. Discover pristine estuaries, the world's first oceanarium, archaeological ruins, live oak canopies, abundant bird life, sea animals, and sand beaches with coquina rock outcroppings. Emerge from maritime hammock to miles of unobstructed ocean view with beaches, boardwalks, pier, and "Old Florida" communities. Be awed by the beauty and take home lasting memories.</description>
