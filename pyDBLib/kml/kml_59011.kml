<name>Wetlands and Wildlife Scenic Byway</name>
<description>Wetlands and Wildlife Scenic Byway moves through radiant wetlands full of wildlife, prairie vistas with immense skies, and rural communities shaped by nature and the entrepreneurial spirit. Clouds of Sandhill and Whooping Cranes descend, and pelicans, Bald and Golden Eagles, shorebirds, ducks, and geese gracefully rest here, capturing the spirit of this byway.</description>
