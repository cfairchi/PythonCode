<name>Beach Boulevard Scenic Byway</name>
<description>Beach Boulevard Scenic Byway runs along the Hancock County coastline for 11.8 miles from the Cedar Point boat ramp on the north end to Cadet Bayou Harbor on the southern end. When you drive the byway, you'll see a range of national and state landmarks including historic buildings and districts. Stop at one of several piers that jut out from the boulevard or at the byway's many birding sites. Or stretch your legs on the trails or play disk golf at Buccaneer State Park.</description>
