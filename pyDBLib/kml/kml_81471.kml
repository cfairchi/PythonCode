<name>Kansas Historic Route 66 Byway</name>
<description>The byway offers opportunities for visitors to enjoy a variety of experiences and get their own kicks while driving the original Kansas portion of Route 66, found in the Ozark Plateau or southeast corner of the state. Museums, murals and ghost writing found along the way tell the local history of life along the route. A traveler can drive over many of the original structures of The Mother Road, including the only remaining Marsh Arch Bridge on Route 66, and even explore the mining and railroad history of the area.</description>
