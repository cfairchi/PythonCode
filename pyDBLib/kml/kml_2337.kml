<name>Snake River Canyon Scenic Byway</name>
<description>The Snake River Canyon Scenic Byway is a rich tapestry of places, people, and scenic lands that encompasses all that is truly Idaho. Nearly 15,000 years ago water reshaped the land as one of the largest floods in geologic history flooded the entire valley from Idaho to Oregon via the Snake and Columbia River. Over the millenniums, nature continued to define the land, creating a unique ecosystem of wildlife and plants that are found only in southwestern Idaho.</description>
