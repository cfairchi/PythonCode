<name>Las Vegas Strip</name>
<description>Las Vegas Boulevard is one of America's only nighttime byways and possibly the most concentrated collection of neon and lights in the world. A trip down the Strip is an all-inclusive way to experience the heart of Las Vegas -- an adventure that captures 75 years of history, glitz, and roadside charm.</description>
